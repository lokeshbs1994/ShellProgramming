# Basic Programming of ShellProgramming

Programming Construct
A Programming Construct is to control the order/flow in which instructions are executed
Programming Statement
In programming languages, the expression which translates to an instruction is called a programming statement or just statement
Programming Constructs Classification
Sequences

A sequence construct tells the CPU (processor) which statement is to be executed next.

Selection

A selection statement provides for selection between alternatives
A program can take certain route depending on a situation and selection statements help in choosing between the routes.
-Selection Statement Types

If statements
Case Statements
Pattern Matching
Repetition

A repetition construct causes a group of one or more program statements to be invoked repeatedly until some end condition is met.

Repetition Statement Types

Fixed count loops - repeat a predefine number of times.
-for (( … )) do done

Variable count loops - repeat an unspecified
number of times.
-while [ … ] do done

Functions
•Functions in Bash Scripting are a great way to reuse code.
•Think of a function as a small script within a script. It's a small chunk of code which you may call multiple times within your script. They are particularly useful if you have certain tasks which need to be performed several times.

Arrays
-An array is a systematic arrangement of the same type of data.
-But in Shell script Array is a variable which contains multiple values may be of same type or different type since by default in shell script everything is treated as a string.
-An array is zero-based i.e. indexing start with 0.

Dictionaries
Dictionary / associative arrays / hash map
-very useful data structures
-Dictionary are key value map similar to HaspMap in Java or the one in python
